# Next.js RAG Application with LangChain

Welcome to the Next.js RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application built with LangChain!

## Overview

This repository contains a sample application that demonstrates how to build a RAG application using Next.js and LangChain. The application leverages the power of OpenAI for natural language processing and the flexibility of Next.js for building modern web applications.

## Features

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **LangChain**: A framework for creating applications powered by language models.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Seamless integration with OpenAI's API for natural language processing.
- **Light & Dark Modes**: A user-friendly interface with support for both light and dark themes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later) or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pieter1821/nextjs-rag-langchain.git
    cd nextjs-rag-langchain
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
    ```

4. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Usage

- **Provide your own `.env.local` file with an OpenAI API key**
